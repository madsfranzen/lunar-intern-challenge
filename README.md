# üöÄ Lunar Frontend Intern Challenge

Welcome to the Lunar Frontend Intern Challenge! We‚Äôve recreated a small feature inspired by real production code ‚Äî a transaction list ‚Äî and your mission is to add new functionality and polish it. You‚Äôll be working with React, TypeScript, styled-components, and GraphQL (one query + one mutation are already scaffolded). The challenge consists of a few main tasks plus a bunch of optional ones.

## ü§ñ AI usage

**Using AI is not considered cheating** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tool like any other, and knowing how to use it well is part of being a modern developer.

AI tools are a natural part of modern development workflows, and we don‚Äôt expect you to avoid them during this challenge. In fact, knowing how to use AI effectively and responsibly is a valuable skill ‚Äî one we consider important.

You‚Äôre welcome to use AI for guidance, inspiration, or to help solve problems. All we ask is that you make a brief note (in comments, commit messages, or a small section at the end of this README) wherever AI meaningfully contributed to your solution. Most importantly, make sure you fully understand and can take ownership of the code you submit.

## üõ† Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start  # opens http://localhost:3000
```

When the dev server starts you‚Äôll see a simple app with a home page and a sidebar where you can navigate to the transactions view. Here you'll see a table of mock transactions fetched with `useTransactionsQuery`. The data is mocked locally.

## üö© Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Delete an authorization (main task)

Every transaction has a status ‚Äî either future, financial, or **authorization**. The purpose of this task is to add functionality that lets you delete transactions with the **authorization** status.

Add a ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button on transaction rows where:

- `status === "authorization"`

Use the generated mutation hook:

```ts
import { useDeleteAuthorizationMutation } from "./transactions/delete_authorization";
```

Baseline (required):

1. Execute the mutation.
2. Make the row disappear after deletion **by adding** `refetchQueries: ['GetTransactions']` _or_ by filtering local state.

Extra-credit (optional): skip the refetch and update the UI **optimistically** using either `optimisticResponse` _or_ the `update(cache)` function.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sort by date (main task)

Add a toggle (button or clickable column header) that switches between ‚Äúnewest first‚Äù and ‚Äúoldest first‚Äù. Sorting must run client-side only.

---

## ‚ú® Stretch goals (optional)

If you finish the main tasks and still have time, here are some optional improvements you can explore:

1. Implement an optimistic cache update (if not already done).
2. Refine the visual design ‚Äî improve table readability with theme colors, hover states, etc.
3. Add support for multi-criteria sorting (e.g., by status or title).
4. Make rows interactive ‚Äî clicking a row could open a details drawer, dialog, or another pattern you think fits well
5. Improve loading and error states to enhance the user experience.
6. Add theme-switching functionality (a dark theme already exists in theme.ts).

---

## ‚è± Expected time

We expect you to spend up to eight hours on this challenge ‚Äî and remember, we value good, clean code and a clear commit history more than the number of stretch goals completed. Focus on clarity, structure, and maintainability ‚Äî that‚Äôs what we care about most.

---

## üì¶ Submission

Push your solution to a public GitHub repo (or private and invite us) and share the link, or zip the folder and email it.

Good luck ‚Äì and have fun! ‚ú®

## ü§ñ Notes on my use of AI

I use AI extensively while developing and learning, primarily as a conversational pair-programmer/mentor. I do **not** use inline AI code completion or other tools inside my editor. I prefer an external workflow (ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar in a separate window) because I feel that it lets **me** control the context and lead the conversation much better. I form my own ideas and hypotheses first, then show the most relevant code or questions to the AI - similar to how you‚Äôd discuss a problem with a human mentor rather than handing them all your files and asking them to ‚Äúfix this.‚Äù

In this challenge, AI was particularly helpful for working with Apollo and GraphQL, which I had not used before - it was a huge help to me, making it easy and fast for me to figure out how to interact with Apollo. I used AI for guidance on React patterns as well inspiration for UI pieces. My workflow is to ask for clean, minimal examples with focus on best practices and maintainability, then adapt those suggestions to fit the project and the specific problem. I like to make the AI play devil‚Äôs advocate against both my ideas and its own, helping me view problems from multiple perspectives. 

I feel that this workflow allows me to work quickly, develop clean and efficient solutions, and maintain a clear view of the big picture, while taking full ownership of my code.
